  <h2>Re: Ta-daaaaa!</h2>
  <p>You are now using the version everybody was expecting! üòú</p>
  <h4>What's new</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>The selection of dark themes has been improved to be more coherent.</li>
    <li>The <s>toolbar</s> <strong>control bar</strong> is back and has been improved! You can now choose to place controls within the video player or within the control bar, and place the control bar at the bottom of the window like in previous versions of the extension, or place it below the video player. The control bar also adapts to all the themes. For more details check the <strong>‚ÄúOptions > Video player > Controls‚Äù</strong> section of the options page.</li>
    <li>Added an option to keep controls visible without having to click the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ control or hover over it with the mouse cursor. In addition, the ‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢ control will be automatically hidden if there is only one control used in this section of the video player.</li>
    <li>The size of the expanded video player is based on other options. For example, if you place controls within the video player or the control bar, the location of the control bar, if the control bar is only visible when hovering over it with the mouse cursor or not, if you control the volume level with the mouse wheel or not, with or without pressing the right mouse button, etc... Obviously, users with a 4:3 monitor will see no difference, no need to report a supposed bug...</li>
    <li>Added an option to not change the color of the vertical black bars when the YouTube-DeepDark theme is applied or when the cinema mode is enabled, check the ‚ÄúOptions > Video player > Appearance‚Äù section of the options page.</li>
    <li>It was already possible to make a ‚Äúctrl + click‚Äù on the video to select the default playback speed, now you can make a ‚Äúctrl + shift + click‚Äù on the video to select the normal speed (1x).</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>What has been fixed</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Controls not always created.</li>
    <li>Video player not always expanded even if the extension was configured to automatically expand the video player.</li>
    <li>Theater mode issues caused by the bug mentioned above.</li>
    <li>Embedded videos were not ‚Äúenhanced‚Äù since the last big update.</li>
    <li>Videos loaded in a temporary playlist in a background tab were paused even if the extension was configured to not prevent autoplay for playlists.</li>
    <li>When videos were completely stopped the timestamp parameter in the URL was ignored and the video started from the beginning when the play button was clicked.</li>
    <li>When multiple windows were open, keyboard shortcuts were executed for all the active YouTube tabs.</li>
  </ul>
